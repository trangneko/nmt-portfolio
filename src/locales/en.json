    "description": "I’m a first-year professional and a recent graduate of Digital Hollywood University in Tokyo, where I specialized in web design and UI/UX design. My passion for the creative field began in high school, and during university, I developed a strong interest in web development as well.\n Outside of work, I enjoy photography, playing rhythm games, and exploring retail trends. I also run a small business as a personal project, which allows me to continuously learn and apply practical skills. \nI’m excited to keep growing as a designer and developer, especially in the fields of web design, web applications, and mobile app development.",
